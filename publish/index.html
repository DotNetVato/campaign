The Sheriff's Office is responsible for jail operations, court security, patrol, investigations, and countywide public safety. That responsibility requires thoughtful leadership prepared to guide the organization forward. </p> <p> Beller brings both deep local experience and a broad leadership perspective. He worked undercover for the Kenosha County Sheriff's Office from October 1998 through January 2001 and served on the Sheriff's Tactical Response Team from 2007 through 2010. Over nearly three decades in law enforcement, he has risen from patrol officer to Police Captain, leading investigative divisions, training programs, and regional critical-incident teams. He has managed people, budgets, policy, and high-risk operations, and worked closely with local, state, and federal partners to protect the community. </p> <p> Kenosha County deserves a Sheriff who understands the organization, respects its people, and is prepared to lead it into the future. James Beller is running to provide steady leadership, clear standards, and professional accountability across every function of the Sheriff's Office. </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section id="platform" class="platform"> <div class="container"> <h2>Platform</h2> <div class="platform-text"> <p> As Sheriff, I will lead with integrity, enforce the law fairly, support the professionals who serve in the Sheriff's Office, and always put public safety ahead of politics. </p> </div> <div class="platform-grid"> <div class="platform-card"> <div class="card-icon">👮‍♂️</div> <h3>Executive Leadership and Organizational Management</h3> <p>James Beller currently serves as a Police Captain and Detective Bureau Commander for the City of Kenosha, where he leads one of the department's most complex and mission-critical divisions.
