                    <p>
                        James Beller has lived in Kenosha County his entire life. Growing up in Paddock Lake, he
                        attended
                        local schools before enlisting in the United States Army. After his Army service, he returned to
                        Paddock while he attended college. He built his career here, raised his family here, and has
                        spent nearly three decades serving and protecting the people of Kenosha County. His commitment
                        to public safety is not a slogan. It is measured in years of leadership, responsibility, and
                        results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A United States Army veteran, Beller began his public safety career serving Kenosha County as a
                        dispatcher with the Kenosha Joint Services Communications Center before joining the Kenosha
                        County Sheriff's Office, where he worked as an undercover narcotics agent. In January 2001, he
                        joined the City of Kenosha Police Department, beginning what would become a nearly three-decade
                        career in law enforcement leadership.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout his career, Beller has focused on strengthening public safety institutions from the
                        inside out. He has modernized operations, improved accountability, and built specialized units
                        to ensure serious crimes are investigated professionally and thoroughly. His leadership
                        philosophy is simple: strong organizations, clear standards, and disciplined execution are what
                        keep communities safe.</p>
                    <p>
                        As Sheriff, Beller will bring the same professional, steady leadership to the Kenosha County
                        Sheriff's Office, ensuring the agency remains trusted, effective, and prepared for the future.
                    </p>

                    <p>James Beller currently serves as a Police Captain and Detective Bureau Commander for the City of Kenosha, where he leads one of the department’s most complex and mission-critical divisions. He oversees approximately 60 sworn personnel across nine specialized units responsible for homicides, crimes against children, sensitive crimes, and major investigations.</p>

                    <h3>Regional and Inter-Agency Leadership</h3>
                    <p>Wisconsin law requires that officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths be investigated by an independent outside agency. To meet that requirement, the Kenosha Racine Area Investigative Team (KRAIT) was formed, bringing together investigators from multiple law enforcement agencies across two counties.</p>

                    <p>In addition to his executive responsibilities, Beller has commanded critical public safety operations. He served as second-shift Patrol Commander during the 2020 civil unrest, directing personnel, coordinating resources, and working alongside local, state, and federal partners during the most challenging public safety crisis in Kenosha’s history.</p>

                    <p>Beller brings a rare perspective, having served both as a command-level executive and as a union leader. He previously served as Second Vice President of the Kenosha Professional Police Association and later as Vice President of the Kenosha Police Supervisory Officers Association, where he participated in labor relations, discipline processes, and contract negotiations.</p>
